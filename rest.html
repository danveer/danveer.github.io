# Web Development

## REST
* Resource centric, not action focused
* Resources are nouns not verbs
* REST maturity model
	* 3: Add HATEOAS
		* tell clients how to use api and where resources are allocated
	* 2: Add HTTP verbs
		* many URIS/resources, all HTTP verbs
	* 1: Add URIs
		* many URIs/resources 1 HTTP method
	* 0: XML - RPC / SOAP
		* 1 URI, 1 HTTP method
* HATEOAS
	* Navigable API vs RPC where you need to know available actions in advance
	* Descriptive responses
	* Returning back available actions and how to execute
	* analogy
		* browse public website, all need is root address and then can discover other elements via hypermedia links and forms. You can transition from state to state, the website is the state machine
* HTTP status codes
	* 1XX - informational
	* 2XX - success
	* 3XX - redirection
	* 4XX - client error
	* 5XX - server error
* Pros and cons of REST
* HTTP verbs
	* Idempotent verbs - should never return an error
		* GET
		* PUT - create if does not exist
		* DELETE
	* Collection URI (http://server.com/tasks)
		* GET - list all tasks
		* PUT - replace entire collection
		* POST - create a new single tasks, ID generated by system
		* DELETE - delete entire collection
	* Element URI (http://server.com/tasks/123)
		* GET
		* PUT - replace/create single task, caller generates ID
		* POST - creates subordinate under task
		* DELETE
* Stateless
* HTTP != REST
* REST vs RPC
* Promotes interoperability

### Web API
* Content negogiation
* HTTP message life cycle
	* HTTPRequestMessage
		1. Message handlers
		2. Filters
		3. Controller
	* HTTPResponseMessage
		1. Controller
		2. Filters
		3. Result conversion
		4. Message handlers
* Web API 2
	* Attribute routing
	* Route constraints
	* CORS support
	* Global error handling
	* IHttpActionResult
* Handlers
	* execute custom code before controller has been activated
* Filters
	* Code before / after controller action methods 
	* e.g. authorization, exception filters
* Design considerations
	* Resource design + relationships
	* URI design
	* Non-resource centric actions - create conceptual resources
		* Filtering + sorting + paging
	* Decide on REST maturity level
	* Design API inputs and outputs
	* Security
		* Options
			* HTTP basic + SSL
				* Authorization header - username:password - base64
			* OAuth
		* Authentication + authorization
			* Use message handler + claims + Authorize filters
	* Input validation
	* Exception handling
	* Logging
	* API versioning
