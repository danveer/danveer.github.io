# Architectures

## Service-oriented architectures (SOA)

* What?
	* decomposition of a system into autonomous units of responsibility
	* essentially API exposing functionality
	* traditionally done with SOAP

## Microservices

* What?
	* architectural style - SOA 2.0
	* complex applications are composed of small autonomous processes communicating with each other using language agnostic APIs
	* services are small and dedicated to do a single task
		* e.g. created around features or departments
	* autonomous
		* no shared implementation, it's own database
	* loosely coupled
		* can be implemented in any language or platform
* Pros?
	* easier to maintain
	* easier to version
		* can just stand up a new service along side existing one
	* each can use own technology stack
	* failure isolation
		* easily scaled, queues
	* observable
		* as individually hosted, can see CPU + memory usage
	* each UI element has its own microservice
		* amazon does this, so page can still load
	* separate deployment
		* no monolith, easier to test
* Cons?
	* duplicated data, each service has its own data
	* duplicated business logic / code in each service
